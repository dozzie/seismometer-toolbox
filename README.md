Seismometer Toolbox
===================

Seismometer Toolbox is a set of tools intended as help in building monitoring
systems. The toolbox is designed around the idea that most of the work in
a monitoring system consists of generating, forwarding, processing, and
storing streams of structured data. The primary data interchange format is
linewise JSON.

An important feature of Seismometer Toolbox is small dependency footprint:
only Python 2.7 and YAML parser are necessary to run the tools.

Seismometer Toolbox is part of a larger project
[Seismometer](http://seismometer.net/), monitoring system of modern
architecture and flexibility.
